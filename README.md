LL Tactics
1. Project Description

LLTactics is a medieval fantasy web game inspired by the autochess model. In it, players compete for victory by strategically purchasing and upgrading characters and items.

Matches take place in two alternating phases:

Purchase Phase: Players can spend stars to acquire units and items, refresh the shop, assign items to their units, or remove elements from their inventory (via double-click).

Battle Phase: Teams face each other automatically until only one side has surviving units. The losing player of the round loses health points. The game continues until one player reaches zero (or fewer) health points.

LLTactics features an automatic matchmaking system. In addition, matches include an integrated chat system that allows players to communicate in real time, as well as a report button that enables reporting inappropriate behavior to maintain a healthy community.

Players can also access various informative and social views:

Item and Hero Gallery: Shows all heroes (sorted by factions) and items available in the game, along with their stats and detailed descriptions.

Ranking: Displays the top players on the server, including their key statistics. This view is dynamic and allows clicking on each player to access their profile.

Rules: Clearly summarizes the game rules to help new and veteran players understand its mechanics.

User Profile: Shows personalized information such as the player's favorite faction, most-used character, mastery points, and win/loss percentages.

Administrators have exclusive views and tools for managing the game environment:

Game and User Management: Allows reviewing ongoing or completed matches, as well as banning users for inappropriate behavior and unbanning them.

Game Constants Modification: Ability to adjust starting parameters of matches, such as economy, base health, or other key factors.

Content Management: A view dedicated to adding, modifying, or removing heroes and items available in the game, maintaining balance.
